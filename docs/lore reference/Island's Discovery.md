# Island's Discovery

## Previous Explorations (from the Field Guide Entry on Île Volcan)

The first recorded discovery of Poppy Seed Pets island is by French explorers in the early 1500s, by the ship HMS Grand Rapace. According to the captain's log, its volcano was in the midst of an eruption, so the crew did not go ashore. They named the island "Île Volcan" - Volcano Island - observed it for a couple days, and moved on.

The second recorded exploration of the island is by a Russian ship in the mid 1720s, captained by Chestibor Grankin. According to Grankin's logs, they had received special orders directly from the Emperor, Peter the Great, to establish a presence on the island. Russia had apparently learned of the island's existence through the Spanish, however somewhere along the line "Île Volcan" had been misunderstood to be the name of the island's volcano, and not of the island itself.

Peter the Great died in 1725, possibly while Grankin's ship was still at sea. Unaware of the Emperor's death, Grankin and his crew continued their mission, and established a small settlement on the island. However, a couple years later, they all died of unknown causes. Remains of their settlement, as well as several unusual clockwork installations, can still be found on the island today.

## Today

See [The World](The%20World.md) for more, but tl;dr:

1. In modern times, the island was found to contain a wormhole to the "Hollow Earth".
2. A research base was established by HERG - the Hollow Earth Research Group - to study the wormhole.
3. Their study included widening the wormhole to send explorers in. Those explorers never came back, but odd creatures now come out of the portal - the pets of Poppy Seed Pets!
4. The island is now home to a small community of people who live with these creatures.
