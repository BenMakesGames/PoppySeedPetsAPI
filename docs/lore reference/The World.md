# The World

The World of Poppy Seed Pets is a hodgepodge of different ideas, mostly borrowed from history, games, and anime.

## The Hollow Earth

### In Real Life

IRL, the Hollow Earth was proposed long ago as a theory to explain how and why the Earth's magnetic poles exist, and drift over time!

The idea has inspired works of fiction, and superstitions, for centuries. Various real-life people have gone looking for entrances at various times throughout history.

Pseduo-scientific claims about the Hollow Earth include:

* Amelia Earhart accidentally flew into the Hollow Earth.
* When Atlantis sunk, it sunk all the way into the Hollow Earth.
* Hitler was looking for the Hollow Earth, as a potential way to detect allied submarines from beneath.
* The Pyramids of Giza were built by aliens who lived in the Hollow Earth. Inside the Earth, the pyramids were built balancing on their tips. They were then pushed through the crust to the surface of the Earth, where they ended the right way up.
* Snake-people - naga - live in passages between the surface and the Hollow Earth.

### In Poppy Seed Pets

According to some versions of string theory, there are many spatial dimensions beyond our three, tightly curled, and generally inaccessible.

Early in Earth's history, an advanced alien species colonized the Earth by uncurling some of these spatial dimensions, creating a bubble of livable space time that's gravitationally-bound to the Earth.

The aliens eventually left (no one knows why), but they left many life forms behind: precursors to the pets of Poppy Seed Pets! A few of the aliens were also left behind: the Abandondero.

Over the course of history, humans have occasionally stumbled into this bubble of space, believing it to be inside the Earth, giving rise to the Hollow Earth theory.

### In PsyPets

PsyPets' Halloween event included aliens coming to Earth to scout it out for potential re-habitation. The players & their pets would dress up as these aliens in order to trick, and ultimately defeat them.

## Poppy Seed Pets Island

Poppy Seed Pets Island is home to a research base owned by HERG - the Hollow Earth Research Group - who found a wormhole to the Hollow Earth on the island, and are now studying it.

They intentionally widened the wormhole and sent explorers in, but those explorers were never heard from again. No one has gone in, since... but all kinds of odd creatures sure do come out!

People now come to the island to live here with those creatures - the pets of PsyPets, and of Poppy Seed Pets.

### In PsyPets

HERG's director was Eve Heidel. Her husband was one of the explorers who went into the wormhole. She worked hard to ensure the continued existence and funding of HERG, with the hopes of one day finding her husband.

From https://www.psypets.net/npcprofile.php?npc=Eve+Heidel:

<blockquote>
Science Today Magazine printed an interview with me in their August 2007 issue, which I received permission to post here. The interviewer is Matt Bradwell (MB). EH is of course for Eve Heidel.

MB: How did you first come across the notion of the Hollow Earth, and what made you decide to pursue it?

EH: Actually, it was my husband's work, initially. We were both physics professors at the same university - that's how we met - and he'd developed this theory that what people had been referring to as the Hollow Earth was actually an unfurled Calabi-Yau Manifold... a kind of bubble of space lying "off to the side" as it were, of normal space. The Earth, of course, is not hollow. Anyway, Keith, my husband, figured out a way to get some readings of this space, and shortly after... he went there. No one has seen him since. And that gives you an answer to the second part of your question. I've picked up the work, and have been trying to find out how to get more people there, so we can find him. We've made some progress, of course - the PsyPets are proof of that - but I haven't been able to get any readings regarding Keith's whereabouts.

MB: Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

EH: No, it's alright. Please continue.

MB: Right. Next question. What is your favorite PsyPet, and why?

EH: I barely have time to take care of any myself. Really, none of us do, that's why we started looking for volunteers. At first we were only using the PsyPets to experiment on pulling things through from the Hollow Earth, we didn't realize they were sentient at the time, and I'm admit there were several accidents early on. Um, but to get more to your question, I did take care of one for a while: Lukas, a Fountain-Tailed Cat. He was a real sweetie. I don't know what happened, but one day he was just gone. Shortly thereafter we suddenly had PsyPets coming in uncontrollably from Hollow Earth. I can't help but to think that Lukas had something to do with it. That's when we put out the call for volunteers.

MB: Bubbles of space, PsyPets... I think a question on a lot of people's minds is how Hollow Earth will affect the rest of the world.

EH: It's hard to say. I can tell you that most governments have instituted very strict laws against bringing anything from Hollow Earth in to their countries. Not just the PsyPets, but any of the plant life, such as Aging Root. Not that I disagree with that standpoint - mixing ecosystems can have unpredictable and disastrous results - but I feel like this isn't the only way in which we're being quarantined here. For example, we've found remains of a large and complex civilization in Hollow Earth, which Julio Beiler has been studying. Who were these people? Were they even human? Where did they go? The answers to these questions could have powerful ramifications on how we look at the world - the universe - but so far the entire topic is ignored by most of the scientific community. Some people even say that this whole project is a stunt. I know those kind of people change their mind if they'd actually come here, but of course they never do.

MB: Hm. Well, hopefully this interview will give some of those people pause for thought. Another question I've heard, somewhat along those lines, stems from the increased funding you're receiving from private businesses. Saying that Hollow Earth is a stunt is really on the mild side, compared to theories that you're building up your forces for world domination. Do you have anything to say in regards to these kinds of theories?

EH: I hope that these "theories" are as immediately ridiculous to most people as they are to me, and everyone else here. I think the worst one I read about on some web site suggested that I killed my husband and created this whole thing to cover it up... Anyway, I think this interview speaks for itself.

MB: Sorry, I can tell this topic upsets you. I have one last question: what were you like as a child? Were you always interested in science, and space, and aliens and the like?

EH: Kind of. I wouldn't say aliens so much as dragons. I read a lot of fantasy stories when I was young, so in a way I guess that prepped me for the weirder side of science. I remember what finally got me interested in the real nitty-gritty science was a physics class I took in high school. I was trying to get as many of the "advanced" classes as possible for my college resume, of which physics was one, especially in my school, which was largely dominated by football jocks and cheerleaders. Anyway, I'd never thought I'd be so interested in the topic. I thought I'd write - I just happened to also have a knack for math. But then I took this physics class, and realized that's what I wanted to do in college. My parents were happy to support me whatever I did, so long as I did it. Physics, writing, didn't matter to them. Hm. Was there anything else?

MB: No, that about it wraps it up. Thank you, Eve, for your time.

EH: Of course.

## World of Darkness, Dungeons &amp; Dragon, and Lain inspirations

The world of Poppy Seed Pets draws heavy inspiration from The World of Darkness table top role-playing games, and the anime Lain.

### World of Darkness

1. The universe takes on the form of the consensus belief of its inhabitants.
   * If people believe in fairies, then fairies exist.
   * If people believe the planets orbit the sun, then the planets orbit the sun.
2. Unpopular beliefs are only able to exist in the Umbra, a shadowy reflection of the world we know.
   * Many people believe in an afterlife, and so the souls of the recently dead can be found in parts of the Umbra that are relatively close - so close, the two worlds sometimes touch, explaining why people see ghosts...
   * Fewer people believe in any particular alien species, and so aliens are only found deeper in the Umbra.
   * Dreams, and other passing thoughts, flit in and out of existence in remote corners of the Umbra.
3. Werewolves, vampires, fairies, and other intelligent creatures that were once widely believed in now exist primarily by their own belief in themselves - a precarious state of existence.
   * These creatures are primarily found in the Umbra, as the physical world has become unsafe for them (the Sun is deadly to vampires, for example).

### Lain

1. Access to the digital world "Project-E" requires a pet to know "Protocol 7" - the upcoming network protocol in Lain that is said will bring the real world and the online world together.
2. In Lain, Eiri Masami is (maybe) the creator of Protocol 7. Poppy Seed Pets' electronics-hungry weekly spirit is called an "Eiri Persona".

### Dungeons and Dragons

D&D was a larger influence on PsyPets (which has a Wand of Wonder, and Deck of Many Things) than it is on Poppy Seed Pets. That said...

* In D&D there's a spell Wizards can learn that lets you summon extra-planar creatures to do your bidding. The game rules point out that there's no reason a player's character couldn't be summoned by some extra-planar NPC to fight for that NPC. In Poppy Seed Pets, there is a small chance that a pet is summoned by a wizard to do household chores.
* Wizard spells can also be put to scrolls: Poppy Seed Pets' Monster-summoning Scroll summons pets. These scrolls are also more likely to summon pets of the Sentinel species, a species which resembles one of D&D's most famous monsters: the Beholder.
* PsyPets had a Wand of Wonder, and a Wand of Wonder was half-coded in Poppy Seed Pets a couple times... it was never finished, but it's where the "Wonderous" merits come from: those were initially going to be gained from possible outcomes of using a Wand of Wonder.
* D&D contains many "planes of existence". In a lot of ways, the idea overlaps with The Umbra from the World of Darkness - any "plane" from D&D could be some remote place within World of Darkness' Umbra. That said, "the Fructal Plane" was created with D&D's elemental planes in mind: besides having "plane" in the name, D&D's elemental planes came in opposing pairs which is represented in Poppy Seed Pets by Goodberries, Evilberries, and the yin-yang pet badge associated with the Fructal Plane. 

## Le Manoir de Chocolat

PSP ended up with a lot of chocolate stuff in it, so why not double down?

## Magic Beanstalk

Obviously inspired by Jack and the Beanstalk. At the top of the beanstalk there's even a huge castle with a giant in it.
